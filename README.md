# napoliclubparigi_php

Project of the club napoliclubparigi2018 website.

I created the site in php with a pure MVC patern, without any framework; this choice is due to the need to use a php hosting server and, having to learn a framework, like somfony2, contrasted with the short creation times of this first version. A more professional evolution of the site was planned, but the project was suspended and abandoned following discordant visions of the direction to take (not of the site but of the club).
sin!
